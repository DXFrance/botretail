# Retail bot sample

If you have any question about this sample, ping me on http:www.twitter.com/meulta

If you want to run that sample :
  1. Clone the repo
  2. npm install
  3. gulp
  4. npm start

Then you can use the **Bot Channel Emulator** to test it.

If you want to setup your own **LUIS** app, create one using this file as a starting point: https://github.com/DXFrance/botretail/blob/master/setup/luis.msbot.json

Then, change the **LUIS id** in this file : https://github.com/DXFrance/botretail/blob/master/bot/retailbot.dialogsManager.ts to make it match your instance.

To deploy it on **BotFramework** (and Facebook, Skype, Slack, etc.), start here : http://botframework.com
