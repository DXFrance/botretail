# Retail bot sample

If you want to run that sample :
1. Clone the repo
2. npm install
3. gulp
4. npm start

Then you can use the Bot Channel Emulator to test it.

If you want to setup your own LUIS app, create one using this file as a starting point: https://github.com/DXFrance/botretail/blob/master/setup/luis.msbot.json

Then, change the LUIS id in this file : https://github.com/DXFrance/botretail/blob/master/bot/retailbot.dialogsManager.ts to make it match your instance.

To deploy it on BotFramework, start here : http://botframework.com
